// Define an array of numbers
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

// Use the filter method on the array to create a new array containing only the odd numbers
const oddNumbers = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 !== 0);

// Print the odd numbers

console.log("Odd numbers:", oddNumbers);





// # Explanation:

// We start by defining an array called numbers that contains some integers.
// We use the filter method on the numbers array. The filter method creates a new array containing only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
// Inside the filter method, we use an arrow function num => num % 2 !== 0 as the test function. This arrow function checks if a number is odd by using the modulo operator (%) to check if the number divided by 2 leaves a remainder (num % 2 !== 0). If the remainder is not 0, then the number is odd and will be included in the new array.
// The filter method returns a new array containing only the odd numbers, which we store in the oddNumbers variable.
// Finally, we use console.log to print the array of odd numbers to the console.
